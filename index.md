#### Data science | NLP | social movements

I'm currently a PhD student [@uvmcomplexity](https://twitter.com/uvmcomplexity) in the [Computational Story Lab](https://twitter.com/compstorylab).
Broadly interested in the narrative capacities of social movements, data privacy, and interpretable ML. 


###### Projects with the story lab team include [StoryWrangler](storywrangling.org), [hedonometer](hedonomter.org), and [POSUTometer](http://compstorylab.org/potusometer/).
